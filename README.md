## Dataset Used

- <a href="https://github.com/Toxinblaze/Sale-Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/Sale%20Data%20Analysis.xlsx">Dataset</a>

## Key Questions

- Why did revenue and quantity decline compared to the previous year?

- Which regions, items, or salespeople performed best?

- What were the monthly trends in price and sales?

- Are there pricing or demand patterns worth acting on?

## Process

- Collected and cleaned sales data from multiple dimensions (item, time, region, personnel).

- Built an MS Excel dashboard with key KPIs and filters for drill-down analysis.

- Compared performance across years, regions, and other dimensions.

## Key Pages & Visualizations

- KPI Summary Cards: Revenue, Quantity, and Average Price with YoY comparison.

- Line Chart: Monthly trend of average price.

## Key Findings

- Revenue and Quantity both dropped 25% YoY, indicating reduced sales activity.

- Average Price remained stable (+1%), suggesting price is not the core issue.

- Texas was the highest grossing region ($117K), followed closely by California.

- Item 2 was the top selling product by quantity.

- Anna Weber and Laura Larsen were the top performing salespeople, both at $276K.

## Insights & Recommendations

- Investigate causes behind volume drop, which is likely tied to reduced demand or fewer transactions.

- Double down on high performing regions (e.g., Texas) and top reps (Anna, Laura) through incentives or expansion.

- Evaluate promotion or bundling strategies for best selling items like Item 2.

- Explore underperforming months (Octoberâ€“December) to understand and address the sharp decline.

- Maintain current pricing strategy while focusing on increasing transaction volume.
